# Prediction of flow and polymeric stresses  in a viscoelastic turbulent channel flow using convolutional neural networks

This folder is supposed to contain the weights of the FCN models employed in this study. Due to size limitations, we host the weights in KTH-One Drive.

The weights for network model can be downloaded from [here](https://kth-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/argb_ug_kth_se/EqKBH2_VlKtChSXIFVdu8qEBC2Vobxkwioek7ME_aqK8SA?e=FNLjVt)
